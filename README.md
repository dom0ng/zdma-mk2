# zdma-mk2
FPGA card looks like an capture card, but hides inside pcileech-fpga researching tool.

# backstory

https://github.com/dom0ng/pcileech-multimedia-hd
variant of multimedia firmware exist since probably 2018

MK2 use a specific chipset (SmartVOD) but it's indeed a Xilinx based board.

This project got abused everywhere and was a top threat back days.
It will outdate any detection mechanism that are based on xilinx artifact, since the whole original and legal device will have all of them.


# Anti-cheats

VGK can make difference and validate it easily

China AC also seems to know how to validate this specific clone, it will be unsafe there or very risky to use.

Faceit block totally this capture card, but safely blocked like the original device.


This project was created to test current top Anti-Cheats against FPGA approach with minimal effort / knowledge with maximal success.
For the vast majority of the lifetime of this project, it was considered as "whitelisted", triggering every is_xilinx detection based.
